 Change History:
  Rev     Description
  -----   -----------
  1.2.5   Fixed bug in the calculation of the capacity for v1.0 devices
  1.3.0   Improved media initialization sequence, for better card compatibility
          (especially with SDHC cards).
          Implemented SPI optimizations for data transfer rate improvement.
          Added new MDD_SDSPI_AsyncReadTasks() and MDD_SDSPI_AsyncWriteTasks() 
          API functions.  These are non-blocking, state machine based read/write
          handlers capable of considerably improved data throughput, particularly
          for multi-block reads and multi-block writes.
  1.3.2   Modified MDD_SDSPI_AsyncWriteTasks() so pre-erase command only gets
          used for multi-block write scenarios.   
  1.3.4   1) Added support for dsPIC33E & PIC24E controllers.
          2) #include "HardwareProfile.h" is moved up in the order.
          3) "SPI_INTERRUPT_FLAG_ASM" macro has to be defined in "HardwareProfile.h" file
             for PIC18 microcontrollers.Or else an error is generated while building
             the code.
                       "#define SPI_INTERRUPT_FLAG_ASM  PIR1, 3" is removed from SD-SPI.c
          4) Replaced "__C30" usage with "__C30__" .
  1.3.6   1) Modified "FSConfig.h" to "FSconfig.h" in '#include' directive.
          2) Moved 'spiconvalue' variable definition to only C30 usage, as C32
             is not using it.
          3) Modified 'MDD_SDSPI_MediaDetect' function to ensure that CMD0 is sent freshly
             after CS is asserted low. This minimizes the risk of SPI clock pulse master/slave
             syncronization problems.

  Summary:

  Input:

  Description:
    The MDD_SDSPI_MediaDetect function determine if an SD card is connected to 
    the microcontroller.
    If the MEDIA_SOFT_DETECT is not defined, the detection is done by polling
    the SD card detect pin.
    The MicroSD connector does not have a card detect pin, and therefore a
    software mechanism must be used. To do this, the SEND_STATUS command is sent 
    to the card. If the card is not answering with 0x00, the card is either not 
    present, not configured, or in an error state. If this is the case, we try
    to reconfigure the card. If the configuration fails, we consider the card not 
    present (it still may be present, but malfunctioning). In order to use the 
    software card detect mechanism, the MEDIA_SOFT_DETECT macro must be defined.

  Function:
    BYTE MDD_SDSPI_AsyncReadTasks(ASYNC_IO* info)
  Summary:
    Speed optimized, non-blocking, state machine based read function that reads 
    data packets from the media, and copies them to a user specified RAM buffer.
  Pre-Conditions:
    The ASYNC_IO structure must be initialized correctly, prior to calling
    this function for the first time.  Certain parameters, such as the user
    data buffer pointer (pBuffer) in the ASYNC_IO struct are allowed to be changed
    by the application firmware, in between each call to MDD_SDSPI_AsyncReadTasks().
    Additionally, the media and microcontroller SPI module should have already 
    been initalized before using this function.  This function is mutually
    exclusive with the MDD_SDSPI_AsyncWriteTasks() function.  Only one operation
    (either one read or one write) is allowed to be in progress at a time, as
    both functions share statically allocated resources and monopolize the SPI bus.
  Input:
    ASYNC_IO* info -        A pointer to a ASYNC_IO structure.  The 
                            structure contains information about how to complete
                            the read operation (ex: number of total bytes to read,
                            where to copy them once read, maximum number of bytes
                            to return for each call to MDD_SDSPI_AsyncReadTasks(), etc.).
  Return Values:
    BYTE - Returns a status byte indicating the current state of the read 
            operation. The possible return values are:
            
            ASYNC_READ_BUSY - Returned when the state machine is busy waiting for
                             a data start token from the media.  The media has a
                             random access time, which can often be quite long
                             (<= ~3ms typ, with maximum of 100ms).  No data
                             has been copied yet in this case, and the application
                             should keep calling MDD_SDSPI_AsyncReadTasks() until either
                             an error/timeout occurs, or ASYNC_READ_NEW_PACKET_READY
                             is returned.
            ASYNC_READ_NEW_PACKET_READY -   Returned after a single packet, of
                                            the specified size (in info->numBytes),
                                            is ready to be read from the 
                                            media and copied to the user 
                                            specified data buffer.  Often, after
                                            receiving this return value, the 
                                            application firmware would want to
                                            update the info->pReceiveBuffer pointer
                                            before calling MDD_SDSPI_AsyncReadTasks()
                                            again.  This way, the application can
                                            begin fetching the next packet worth
                                            of data, while still using/consuming
                                            the previous packet of data.
            ASYNC_READ_COMPLETE - Returned when all data bytes in the read 
                                 operation have been read and returned successfully,
                                 and the media is now ready for the next operation.
            ASYNC_READ_ERROR - Returned when some failure occurs.  This could be
                               either due to a media timeout, or due to some other
                               unknown type of error.  In this case, the 
                               MDD_SDSPI_AsyncReadTasks() handler will terminate
                               the read attempt and will try to put the media 
                               back in a default state, ready for a new command.  
                               The application firmware may then retry the read
                               attempt (if desired) by re-initializing the 
                               ASYNC_IO structure and setting the 
                               bStateVariable = ASYNC_READ_QUEUED.

            
  Side Effects:
    Uses the SPI bus and the media.  The media and SPI bus should not be
    used by any other function until the read operation has either completed
    successfully, or returned with the ASYNC_READ_ERROR condition.
  Description:
    Speed optimized, non-blocking, state machine based read function that reads 
    data packets from the media, and copies them to a user specified RAM buffer.
    This function uses the multi-block read command (and stop transmission command) 
    to perform fast reads of data.  The total amount of data that will be returned 
    on any given call to MDD_SDSPI_AsyncReadTasks() will be the info->numBytes parameter.
    However, if the function is called repeatedly, with info->bytesRemaining set
    to a large number, this function can successfully fetch data sizes >> than
    the block size (theoretically anything up to ~4GB, since bytesRemaining is 
    a 32-bit DWORD).  The application firmware should continue calling 
    MDD_SDSPI_AsyncReadTasks(), until the ASYNC_READ_COMPLETE value is returned 
    (or ASYNC_READ_ERROR), even if it has already received all of the data expected.
    This is necessary, so the state machine can issue the CMD12 (STOP_TRANMISSION) 
    to terminate the multi-block read operation, once the total expected number 
    of bytes have been read.  This puts the media back into the default state 
    ready for a new command.
    
    During normal/successful operations, calls to MDD_SDSPI_AsyncReadTasks() 
    would typically return:
    1. ASYNC_READ_BUSY - repeatedly up to several milliseconds, then 
    2. ASYNC_READ_NEW_PACKET_READY - repeatedly, until 512 bytes [media read 
        block size] is received, then 
    3. Back to ASYNC_READ_BUSY (for awhile, may be short), then
    4. Back to ASYNC_READ_NEW_PACKET_READY (repeatedly, until the next 512 byte
       boundary, then back to #3, etc.
    5. After all data is received successfully, then the function will return 
       ASYNC_READ_COMPLETE, for all subsequent calls (until a new read operation
       is started, by re-initializing the ASYNC_IO structure, and re-calling
       the function).
    
  Remarks:
    This function will monopolize the SPI module during the operation.  Do not
    use the SPI module for any other purpose, while a fetch operation is in
    progress.  Additionally, the ASYNC_IO structure must not be modified
    in a different context, while the MDD_SDSPI_AsyncReadTasks() function is executing.
    In between calls to MDD_SDSPI_AsyncReadTasks(), certain parameters, namely the
    info->numBytes and info->pReceiveBuffer are allowed to change however.
    
    The bytesRemaining value must always be an exact integer multiple of numBytes 
    for the function to operate correctly.  Additionally, it is recommended, although
    not essential, for the bytesRemaining to be an integer multiple of the media
    read block size.
    
    When starting a read operation, the info->stateVariable must be initalized to
    ASYNC_READ_QUEUED.  All other fields in the info structure should also be
    initialized correctly.
    
    The info->wNumBytes must always be less than or equal to the media block size,
    (which is 512 bytes).  Additionally, info->wNumBytes must always be an exact 
    integer factor of the media block size (unless info->dwBytesRemaining is less
    than the media block size).  Example values that are allowed for info->wNumBytes
    are: 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512.

/*****************************************************************************
  Function:
    BYTE MDD_SDSPI_AsyncWriteTasks(ASYNC_IO* info)
  Summary:
    Speed optimized, non-blocking, state machine based write function that writes
    data from the user specified buffer, onto the media, at the specified 
    media block address.
  Pre-Conditions:
    The ASYNC_IO structure must be initialized correctly, prior to calling
    this function for the first time.  Certain parameters, such as the user
    data buffer pointer (pBuffer) in the ASYNC_IO struct are allowed to be changed
    by the application firmware, in between each call to MDD_SDSPI_AsyncWriteTasks().
    Additionally, the media and microcontroller SPI module should have already 
    been initalized before using this function.  This function is mutually
    exclusive with the MDD_SDSPI_AsyncReadTasks() function.  Only one operation
    (either one read or one write) is allowed to be in progress at a time, as
    both functions share statically allocated resources and monopolize the SPI bus.
  Input:
    ASYNC_IO* info -        A pointer to a ASYNC_IO structure.  The 
                            structure contains information about how to complete
                            the write operation (ex: number of total bytes to write,
                            where to obtain the bytes from, number of bytes
                            to write for each call to MDD_SDSPI_AsyncWriteTasks(), etc.).
  Return Values:
    BYTE - Returns a status byte indicating the current state of the write 
            operation. The possible return values are:
            
            ASYNC_WRITE_BUSY - Returned when the state machine is busy waiting for
                             the media to become ready to accept new data.  The 
                             media has write time, which can often be quite long
                             (a few ms typ, with maximum of 250ms).  The application
                             should keep calling MDD_SDSPI_AsyncWriteTasks() until either
                             an error/timeout occurs, ASYNC_WRITE_SEND_PACKET
                             is returned, or ASYNC_WRITE_COMPLETE is returned.
            ASYNC_WRITE_SEND_PACKET -   Returned when the MDD_SDSPI_AsyncWriteTasks()
                                        handler is ready to consume data and send
                                        it to the media.  After ASYNC_WRITE_SEND_PACKET
                                        is returned, the application should make certain
                                        that the info->wNumBytes and pBuffer parameters
                                        are correct, prior to calling 
                                        MDD_SDSPI_AsyncWriteTasks() again.  After
                                        the function returns, the application is
                                        then free to write new data into the pBuffer
                                        RAM location. 
            ASYNC_WRITE_COMPLETE - Returned when all data bytes in the write
                                 operation have been written to the media successfully,
                                 and the media is now ready for the next operation.
            ASYNC_WRITE_ERROR - Returned when some failure occurs.  This could be
                               either due to a media timeout, or due to some other
                               unknown type of error.  In this case, the 
                               MDD_SDSPI_AsyncWriteTasks() handler will terminate
                               the write attempt and will try to put the media 
                               back in a default state, ready for a new command.  
                               The application firmware may then retry the write
                               attempt (if desired) by re-initializing the 
                               ASYNC_IO structure and setting the 
                               bStateVariable = ASYNC_WRITE_QUEUED.

            
  Side Effects:
    Uses the SPI bus and the media.  The media and SPI bus should not be
    used by any other function until the read operation has either completed
    successfully, or returned with the ASYNC_WRITE_ERROR condition.
  Description:
    Speed optimized, non-blocking, state machine based write function that writes 
    data packets to the media, from a user specified RAM buffer.
    This function uses either the single block or multi-block write command 
    to perform fast writes of the data.  The total amount of data that will be 
    written on any given call to MDD_SDSPI_AsyncWriteTasks() will be the 
    info->numBytes parameter.
    However, if the function is called repeatedly, with info->dwBytesRemaining
    set to a large number, this function can successfully write data sizes >> than
    the block size (theoretically anything up to ~4GB, since dwBytesRemaining is 
    a 32-bit DWORD).  The application firmware should continue calling 
    MDD_SDSPI_AsyncWriteTasks(), until the ASYNC_WRITE_COMPLETE value is returned 
    (or ASYNC_WRITE_ERROR), even if it has already sent all of the data expected.
    This is necessary, so the state machine can finish the write process and 
    terminate the multi-block write operation, once the total expected number 
    of bytes have been written.  This puts the media back into the default state 
    ready for a new command.
    
    During normal/successful operations, calls to MDD_SDSPI_AsyncWriteTasks() 
    would typically return:
    1. ASYNC_WRITE_SEND_PACKET - repeatedly, until 512 bytes [media read 
        block size] is received, then 
    2. ASYNC_WRITE_BUSY (for awhile, could be a long time, many milliseconds), then
    3. Back to ASYNC_WRITE_SEND_PACKET (repeatedly, until the next 512 byte
       boundary, then back to #2, etc.
    4. After all data is copied successfully, then the function will return 
       ASYNC_WRITE_COMPLETE, for all subsequent calls (until a new write operation
       is started, by re-initializing the ASYNC_IO structure, and re-calling
       the function).
    
  Remarks:
    When starting a read operation, the info->stateVariable must be initalized to
    ASYNC_WRITE_QUEUED.  All other fields in the info structure should also be
    initialized correctly.

    This function will monopolize the SPI module during the operation.  Do not
    use the SPI module for any other purpose, while a write operation is in
    progress.  Additionally, the ASYNC_IO structure must not be modified
    in a different context, while the MDD_SDSPI_AsyncReadTasks() function is 
    actively executing.
    In between calls to MDD_SDSPI_AsyncWriteTasks(), certain parameters, namely the
    info->wNumBytes and info->pBuffer are allowed to change however.
    
    The dwBytesRemaining value must always be an exact integer multiple of wNumBytes 
    for the function to operate correctly.  Additionally, it is required that
    the wNumBytes parameter, must always be less than or equal to the media block size,
    (which is 512 bytes).  Additionally, info->wNumBytes must always be an exact 
    integer factor of the media block size.  Example values that are allowed for
    info->wNumBytes are: 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512.

    at high speed for optimum throughput, copied from the user specified RAM
    buffer.
    This function is only implemented and used on PIC18 devices.
  Remarks:
    This function is speed optimized, using inline assembly language code, and
    makes use of C compiler managed resources.  It is currently written to work
    with the Microchip MPLAB C18 compiler, and may need modification if built
    with a different PIC18 compiler.

  Side Effects:

  Description:
    This function will send initialization commands to and SD card.
  Remarks:
    Psuedo code flow for the media initialization process is as follows:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SD Card SPI Initialization Sequence (for physical layer v1.x or v2.0 device) is as follows:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
0.  Power up tasks
    a.  Initialize microcontroller SPI module to no more than 400kbps rate so as to support MMC devices.
    b.  Add delay for SD card power up, prior to sending it any commands.  It wants the 
        longer of: 1ms, the Vdd ramp time (time from 2.7V to Vdd stable), and 74+ clock pulses.
1.  Send CMD0 (GO_IDLE_STATE) with CS = 0.  This puts the media in SPI mode and software resets the SD/MMC card.
2.  Send CMD8 (SEND_IF_COND).  This requests what voltage the card wants to run at. 
    Note: Some cards will not support this command.
    a.  If illegal command response is received, this implies either a v1.x physical spec device, or not an SD card (ex: MMC).
    b.  If normal response is received, then it must be a v2.0 or later SD memory card.

If v1.x device:
-----------------
3.  Send CMD1 repeatedly, until initialization complete (indicated by R1 response byte/idle bit == 0)
4.  Basic initialization is complete.  May now switch to higher SPI frequencies.
5.  Send CMD9 to read the CSD structure.  This will tell us the total flash size and other info which will be useful later.
6.  Parse CSD structure bits (based on v1.x structure format) and extract useful information about the media.
7.  The card is now ready to perform application data transfers.

If v2.0+ device:
-----------------
3.  Verify the voltage range is feasible.  If not, unusable card, should notify user that the card is incompatible with this host.
4.  Send CMD58 (Read OCR).
5.  Send CMD55, then ACMD41 (SD_SEND_OP_COND, with HCS = 1).
    a.  Loop CMD55/ACMD41 until R1 response byte == 0x00 (indicating the card is no longer busy/no longer in idle state).  
6.  Send CMD58 (Get CCS).
    a.  If CCS = 1 --> SDHC card.
    b.  If CCS = 0 --> Standard capacity SD card (which is v2.0+).
7.  Basic initialization is complete.  May now switch to higher SPI frequencies.
8.  Send CMD9 to read the CSD structure.  This will tell us the total flash size and other info which will be useful later.
9.  Parse CSD structure bits (based on v2.0 structure format) and extract useful information about the media.
10. The card is now ready to perform application data transfers.
